### **Project Description**

Create and deploy a simple web application that follows the following requirements:

- Your web app must include a short bio about you and your professional history.
- Your web app should display a few of your side projects or professional projects and should include a link to access the projects.
- Your web app should make an API call to display 3-5 pieces of data you retrieve from the API service. You are welcome to choose whatever API youâ€™d like to use.
    - Include a section to explain why you chose the specific API you used in your project.
- Your web app should be designed using brand colours from the [Co.Lab site](https://www.joincolab.io/). Please reference [our website](https://www.joincolab.io/) and see how we structure information and how buttons and links are designed.
- Your web app must be mobile-responsive.
- Lastly, you must also deploy and host your web app using any service of your choice. (e.g. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), etc.)

Remember to be as creative as possible with your solution. This is your time to shine, and let us know the kind of engineer you are. We want your work to speak for you.
