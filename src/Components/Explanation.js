			<h2>Using an API</h2>
			<p className="summary">I believe the most important API to use is to allow your users to send emails. I had used an email API before, but it was awhile ago and the method was very different than before. I want to get more used to integrating EmailJS so it won't take as long to implement in the future.</p>
